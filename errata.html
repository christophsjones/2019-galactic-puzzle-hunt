    <p>At 6:15pm EDT on Wednesday, March 20, the following announcement was made:</p>
    <div class="no-break story-chunk">
<p>Dear Antarctic Excavators,
<p>
&emsp;A new kind of iceberg is approaching! Our scientists have tentatively named them "answerbergs". These new bergs seem even more powerful than the advicebergs we've been dealing with up to now: exploring an answerberg should give us the <b>entire answer</b> to problems we've been dealing with!

<p>
&emsp;Five total answerbergs will be arriving for each team: the first tomorrow, on Thursday at 6:28 pm EDT, two on Friday at 6:28 pm, and two on Saturday at 6:28 pm. Each answerberg can be used to give you the answer to any one puzzle. Answerbergs cannot be used on metapuzzles. Puzzles solved using answerbergs will still help unlock new puzzles, metapuzzles, and artifacts like before, but will not count toward your solve count on the leaderboard. Answerbergs will not be given to teams which register after 6:00 pm today.

<p>
&emsp;Two advicebergs will continue to arrive each day at 6:28 pm EDT as well. These are distinct from answerbergs and can be used on any puzzle, including metapuzzles, to help get you unstuck. Neither advicebergs nor answerbergs will ever melt: you can store more than two at once.

<p>
&emsp;We hope these will help you unlock and solve the metapuzzles, and figure out the mystery of all the artifacts!<br>
