<p>This puzzle, tasks solvers with looking at a few examples of descriptions
of objects in solar systems, then using the rules learned from the examples
to produce new phrases to describe the unlabeled objects below. The first
insight needed is that each picture has an arrow pointing to one body &mdash;
the associated phrases is therefore a description of that object (e.g.
&ldquo;the planet that is...&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The puzzle tests solvers' recognition that puflantu is consistently
head-final, meaning that the roles of phrases are indicated by the words
occuring at their ends. Japanese is a good example of a real language with
this property (Spanish is an example of the opposite &mdash; it is
head-initial). Solvers are intended to figure this out themselves, perhaps
with some help from the examples given by the artifacts they have collected
up to this point. The puzzle is still solvable without this a-ha, though
resolving the ambiguities in word ordering will lead solvers there eventually
anyhow.</p>

<p>One possible way to make this insight is to notice that if the first
phrase describes a planet, the second phrase describes a spaceship (relative to
a planet), and the third phrase describes another planet, we would expect the
word for planet to appear in all three sentences, but appear in the same
position in the phrase in the first and third but not the second. This
deduction tells us the language is head-final, &ldquo;forovo&rdquo; means
planet (or at least, a smooth planet-shaped object), and &ldquo;qacepo&rdquo;
means spaceship.</p>

<p>Head-final phrase structures means one can then deduce that
&ldquo;pamono&rdquo; is likely the color red and &ldquo;defisa&rdquo; means
spinning (clockwise). The last noun (for the asteroid-shaped object) would
initially appear to be &ldquo;zagtivo-li&rdquo;, but one might notice the
word bank at the top contains <i>noun</i> and <i>noun</i>-li pairs for each
of the previously identified nouns, implying -li is some sort of grammatical
particle rather than part of the base form of a noun. So
&ldquo;zagtivo&rdquo; is a better candidate for asteroid. Solvers might guess
at this point that -li is approximately "and", since it appears between two
nouns being listed in order in the third phrase.</p>

<p>In the second example, we're then left with the unknown words utqunxe-fws
and zulalam-ka, which also appear in the third phrase in the same order.
Since the object being described in each of those is closest to the sun (or
at least closer to the sun than the other objects), solvers may deduce those
two words locate the head of the phrase relative to other objects that appear
earlier in the phrase. From the language artifacts obtained so far, solvers
may expect that the -ka suffix attaches to verbs, so zulalam-ka describes
what one of the nouns in the phrase is doing. One might make the leap at this
point that the stem of the verb is &ldquo;to orbit&rdquo;. utqunxe-fws also
appears in the word bank alongside utqunxe-cws &mdash; their similarity might
clue in solvers to the fact that these are adpositions, -fws being closer to
the sun (presumably, utqunxe) and -cws being further away.</p>

<p>The next step is to try to write out the object descriptions for each of
the unlabeled pictures. For example, the second one comes out in an English
as &ldquo;red planet that orbits further-from-the-sun-than a spaceship and a blue
planet&rdquo; but in puflantu the gloss would be &ldquo;spaceship -li blue
planet sun-away that-orbits red planet&rdquo;. Mapping this back to letters
using the word bank at the top gives D?OINSO (we might not know at this
point which word means blue).</p>

<p>At this point we can start making realizations about this puzzle as a
meta, namely that this contains all the letters of the answer INDOORS. We
know furthermore that the R has to be changed to a different letter, since R
corresponds to forovo-li (spaceship-and). We hypothesize that each jumble of
letters obtained from mapping a picture's description can be rearranged to
the answer of a puzzle that feeds into this meta with one letter changed. The
order of the words is unique, with the added requirement that we list the
things orbiting a planet closer to it than the planet's orbit position.</p>

<p>Working out puflantu descriptions of all of the pictures and pairing
them with puzzle answers will let solvers deduce the meanings of all the
words in the word bank that we actually use in the puzzle:</p>

* It's a bit hard to unambiguously gloss zulolam-ka and zulalam-ka as
English phrases. Their actual composition is zulam "to orbit" with a
relative pronoun infixed: -al- for the subject case and -ol- for the
oblique case. -ka indicates that the verb is the main verb for a
dependent clause; the choice of relative pronoun indicates the role of
the described object in that dependent clause. Thus "X zulalam-ka Y", where X
is an adpositional phrase, is roughly "Y that orbits [in a manner described
by] X" or "X-orbiting Y"; subject case -al- is chosen because "Y" is the
subject of "orbits". "X zulolam-ka Y" is "Y that X orbits" or "X-orbited Y",
using oblique case -ol-.

    <h4>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h4>
    <p>This puzzle is inspired by small self-contained linguistics problems such
as those featured in <a href="https://nacloweb.org/">NACLO</a>. One well-known
NACLO problem is <a
href="https://www.nacloweb.org/resources/problems/2008/N2008-E.pdf">"A Fish
Story"</a>, which requires looking at several examples of fishermen's catches
described with sentences in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language">Aymara language</a>,
then using the vocabulary and syntax rules learned from the examples to
generate a new sentence for another unlabeled picture. This puzzle turned out
to be very similar to "A Fish Story", but with solar systems instead of fish
:)</p><p>An early version of this puzzle involved diagrams of various kinds of
fruit and cardboard boxes instead of planets. I initially chose that sort of
subject because I was really excited not just by putting fruit next to boxes
and inside boxes in various orders, but also by the possibility of nesting
boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes and making solvers get deep into the
recursive structure of dependent clauses in our conlang.
</p><img src="the-astrologers/falconforsolution.png" style="display: block; max-width: 300px; margin: 40px auto"><p>The craziness got toned down a bit when we were coming up with
metameta-related answers and this meta got assigned an answer related to
opposites, which constrained answers feeding into this meta to be reasonable
words with well-defined opposites. The early draft also had some pictures
that were ambiguous in terms of being able to be described in multiple ways.
We quickly realized that solvers preferred to solve this puzzle by looking
at the pictures, trying to come up with a phrase to describe the object in
question, and then trying to match that jumble of letters to a puzzle answer,
rather than what I had originally intended, which was to start with a puzzle
answer, match it to a picture by the composition of nouns (and colors), then
try to put the words in a valid order to describe the picture.
</p><p>These two constraints together prevented us from doing anything too crazy
with complex sets of moons around planets, but I'm happy we managed at least
to keep some diagrams with up to five nouns.</p><p>A big thanks goes to Charles Tam who helped greatly with the conlanging
for this puzzle and suggested major changes to the vocabulary used here, in
particular by adding ofovalen-ka to the lexicon, and tweaking the
semantics of zulolam-ka and zulalam-ka to make them behave more
consistently.</p>
