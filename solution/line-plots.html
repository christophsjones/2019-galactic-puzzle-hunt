This is a puzzle about video game series with weird numbering conventions.

<p>
Each graph represents a series, with games always shown at the x-coordinate
for their original release date. Numbered installments are shown with a dot at
the corresponding y-coordinate; when the numbers are high, the scale is
logarithmic. Those with both numbers and additional words show rebus icons
attached to the dot. Titles without a number use icons only; they are given a
y-coordinate by interpolating between neighboring numbers, which may be
confusing at first, but should eventually become clear. Not every game in every
series is depicted &mdash; I tended to drop ones that would have required their
own icons not shared with any other games &mdash; but most of the mainline
entries in each series should be covered.

<dl>
    <dt>RO<b>L</b>LERCOASTERTYCOON</dt>
    <dd>
        A roller coaster icon is provided as a starting hint. The last two are
        <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile</i> and <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon
        World</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>HA<b>L</b>FLIFE</dt>
    <dd>
        <i>Half-Life 2: Episode One</i> and <i>Two</i> are represented as 2.1
        and 2.2. <i>Half-Life 3</i> has been rumored for over a decade (Gabe
        Newell pictured) but never confirmed.
    </dd>
    <dt>M<b>A</b>RIOPARTY</dt>
    <dd>
        <i>Mario Party</i> has straightforward numbering up to 10, but this
        graph introduces Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS icons. After 10 come
        <i>Mario Party: The Top 100</i> and then <i>Super Mario Party</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>J<b>A</b>MESBOND</dt>
    <dd>
        This graph includes every game titled <i>James Bond 007</i>. It
        unfortunately breaks the rule by not including icons for all the
        subtitles, but they don't really line up with the icons used elsewhere
        and would have been hard to clue. Hopefully the constant line at 7 is
        suspicious enough to give away the series.
    </dd>
    <dt>EUROPAUNI<b>V</b>ERSALIS</dt>
    <dd>
        One of the more obscure and less interesting graphs here. <i>Europa
        Universalis: Rome</i> was released in 2008.
    </dd>
    <dt>RESIDENTE<b>V</b>IL</dt>
    <dd>
        Mostly straightforward, except that <i>Code: Veronica</i> and
        <i>Zero</i> came out before <i>4</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>WARCR<b>A</b>FT</dt>
    <dd>
        This one might be tricky to identify despite how well-known it is. I
        considered including all the <i>World of Warcraft</i> expansions up to
        the present, but as above they would have been hard to clue.
    </dd>
    <dt>STARW<b>A</b>RSBATTLEFRONT</dt>
    <dd>
        EA rebooted the series in 2015.
        <a href="https://2018.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/pride-and-accomplishment">
        Our puzzle</a> from last year references the most recent game.
    </dd>
    <dt>S<b>I</b>DMEIERSCIVILIZATION</dt>
    <dd>
        Now we get into the more interesting icons. <i>CivCity: Rome</i> was
        released in 2006. There were also two <i>Civilization Revolution</i>
        games for consoles, as well as <i>Civilization: Beyond Earth</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>K<b>I</b>NGDOMHEARTS</dt>
    <dd>
        In order: <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>358/2 days</i>, <i>Birth by Sleep</i>,
        <i>3D: Dream Drop Distance</i>, <i>HD Remixes 1.5</i>, <i>2.5</i>,
        <i>2.8</i> (<i>Final Chapter Prologue</i>), and <i>1.5 + 2.5</i> (= 4),
        and <i>3</i>. The icon above for revolution is used here as day. I
        opted not to include the subtitle on <i>Dream Drop Distance</i> as it
        acronyms to <i>3D</i> anyway.
    </dd>
    <dt>MA<b>S</b>SEFFECT</dt>
    <dd>
        <i>Mass Effect Galaxy</i> came out in 2009 for iOS; <i>Mass Effect:
        Andromeda</i> came out in 2017.
    </dd>
    <dt>AS<b>S</b>ASSINSCREED</dt>
    <dd>
        After <i>IV: Black Flag</i>, we have <i>Unity</i> (1), <i>Origins</i>
        (0, 0), then <i>Odyssey</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>B</b>IOSHOCK</dt>
    <dd>
        <i>BioShock Infinite</i> was (asymptotically) released in 2013.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>B</b>ATTLEFIELD</dt>
    <dd>
        Despite the jumping around, each individual installment here should be
        pretty straightforward. The high-numbered ones are <i>1942</i>,
        <i>2142</i>, and <i>1943</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>DRAG<b>O</b>NAGE</dt>

        <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>, <i>II</i>, and <i>Inquisition</i>.

        The main series counts up to <i>4: Modern Warfare</i>, which splits off
        its own series of three games. Then it continues with <i>World at
        War</i>, <i>Advanced Warfare</i>, <i>Infinite Warfare</i>, and
        <i>WWII</i>. The separate line below has a different color because it
        represents the four numbered <i>Black Ops</i> games.
    </dd>
    <dt>ULT<b>I</b>MA</dt>
    <dd>
        Another boring graph, but the early 80s start and very early MMO
        installment (<i>Ultima Online</i>, 1997) can serve as clues. <i>Ultima
        VII</i> had a <i>Part Two</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>MAR<b>I</b>OKART</dt>
    <dd>
        In order: <i>Super Mario Kart</i>, <i>64</i>, <i>Super Circuit</i>,
        <i>Double Dash</i>, <i>DS</i>, <i>Wii</i>, <i>7</i>, and <i>8</i>.
        (<i>8 Deluxe</i> not pictured.)
    </dd>
    <dt>THEE<b>L</b>DERSCROLLS</dt>
    <dd>
        The first icon here means <i>Arena</i>. <i>V: Skyrim</i> was released
        in 2011, followed by <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>FINA<b>L</b>FANTASY</dt>
    <dd>
        <i>Final Fantasy IV</i> and <i>VI</i> were released as <i>II</i> and
        <i>III</i> in North America, after which <i>VII</i> was not altered.
        <i>X</i> had a direct sequel, as did <i>XIII</i>, but <i>Type-0</i>
        is (arguably) in the same series (using the icon that meant code
        above). <i>XIV</i> was relaunched as <i>A Realm Reborn</i>, and
        <i>World of Final Fantasy</i> was released in 2016 shortly before
        <i>XV</i>. (<i>All the Bravest</i> not pictured.)
    </dd>
    <dt>AGEOFEMP<b>I</b>RES</dt>
    <dd>
        <i>Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings</i> released in 1999 and was

    <dd>
        The North American version of <i>Super Mario Bros. 2</i> was famously
        a completely different game rebranded as Mario. After <i>Super Mario
        Bros. 3</i> we have <i>Super Mario Land</i> and <i>World</i>. <i>64</i>
        received a remake as a launch title for the DS. After <i>Sunshine</i>
        we have <i>Galaxy</i> and <i>Galaxy 2</i>, and most recently,
        <i>Odyssey</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>POKEMO<b>N</b>STADIUM</dt>
    <dd>
        The little-known 1998 <i>Pokémon Stadium</i> was released only in
        Japan. Its sequel was released as <i>Pokémon Stadium</i> in North
        America, followed in the second generation by <i>Stadium 2</i>
        (instead subtitled <i>Gold / Silver</i> in Japan). In generation 3,
        abandoning the <i>Stadium</i> name, we have <i>Colosseum</i>,
        <i>XD</i>, and finally <i>Battle Revolution</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>MADDEN<b>N</b>FL</dt>
    <dd>
        Many yearly sports series switched between <i>200X</i> and <i>9X</i>
        / <i>0X</i> / <i>1X</i>, but <i>Madden</i> takes the cake by also
        having <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>64</i>, and <i>25</i> installments.
    </dd>
    <dt>RA<b>G</b>NAROKONLINE</dt>
    <dd>
        <i>Ragnarok Online 2</i> was canceled and rebooted in 2012. Several
        spinoff games released in the interim included <i>Ragnarok DS</i> and
        <i>Ragnarok Odyssey</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>ME<b>G</b>AMAN</dt>
    <dd>
        The classic <i>Mega Man</i> series spanned eight games up to the
        mid-90s. A separate series using Roman numerals was released for the
        Game Boy. The darker blue line represents the <i>X</i> series
        (interpreted as 10), while the red is the <i>Zero</i> series. Finally
        we have the "modern" continuations <i>9</i>, <i>10</i>, and <i>11</i>.
    </dd>

<p>
Since graphs are paired up, write the names of the series next to each other as
clued by the left-aligned enumerations, and read off the unique letter that is
in the same position in both titles. A web search for <tt>LAVA IS BOILING</tt>
will turn up
<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaIsBoilingKoolAid">
a TV Tropes page</a>, so the answer is <tt><b>KOOL AID</b></tt>.

    <h4>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h4>
    <p>
There are unfortunately a few "filler" series that were included to get the
right letters, but I was able to pick most of them based on having interesting
graphs or icons shared with other series. As a result, though, the puzzle ended
up pretty long. Hopefully identification is easy enough to compensate for that;
even testsolvers who didn't play many video games reported that they were able
to find most of the ones they didn't recognize by looking for games released in
certain years with the given enumerations.

<p>
The title of this puzzle is a reference to an MIT Mystery Hunt puzzle named
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2011/puzzles/katamari_damacy/plotlines/">Plotlines</a>
(<a href="https://xkcd.com/657/">inspiration</a>,
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/puzzles/a_circus_line/potlines/">sequel</a>,
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2018/full/puzzle/potlines.html">sequel</a>),
although this puzzle shares little in common with it. I wanted to title it
Hotlines as a subtle Easter egg (a term that here means "cute footnote to put
in the solution") referencing the game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami_2:_Wrong_Number"><i>Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number</i></a>, but was overruled after some
discussion.

<p>
It is interesting to note that the <i>Super Mario</i> series in particular
also provides an ordering of the Earth, Sun, Milky Way, possibly a deity
(<i>Maker</i>), and the Mediterranean Sea, presumably in order of increasing
size, as well as in relation to various numbers. Up to three brothers are
smaller than the world, but the world is no larger than 64. Any conclusions to
be drawn are left as an exercise to the solver.

<p>
Shortly before hunt, it was announced that USB 3.0 would be rebranded as USB
3.2 Gen 1, USB 3.2 Gen 2, and USB 3.2 Gen 2×2. Maybe that should have made it
into this puzzle.
